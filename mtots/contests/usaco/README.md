Solutions to some USACO training problems

The `_template.py` file contains a template that allow
USACO solutions to be easily testable with `mtots.test`.

===

Any problem starting with 'zzz' is actually a past contest problem
These seem to use a different grader now, and don't require special
headers.

The names come from the problem id from the URL.
E.g. http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=831
Has problem id of 831, so the solution is in file zzz831.py
