# mtots
A collection of useful Python utilities

Assumes at least Python 3.6+

Run all tests with 'python -m mtots.test mtots'

## requirements.txt

I try to minimize dependency on external packages,
but some dependencies are difficult to simply copy into mtots.tp.

The requirements.txt file contains a list of packages that
are required for all functionality to work.
